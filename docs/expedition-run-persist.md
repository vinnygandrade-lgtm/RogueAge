# Forest Expedition — mid-run persistence

Players can leave Forest (town, inventory, World, logout) **without extracting**. The bag, journey, path choices, run buffs, and forge enchants stay in the character save until extract/death.

## Save field

- `expeditionRun` on `characters.data` / local save (`L2MINI_SAVE_VERSION` **19**)
- Payload builder: `ExpeditionEngine.getRunSavePayload()`
- Restore: `ExpeditionEngine.applyRunFromSave()` in `carregarJogo`
- **Between-run ledger:** `expeditionMeta` (`ExpeditionMeta` / `src/systems/expedition_meta.ts`) — best journey, extracts/deaths, best bag Adena, last run line (per zone + lifetime). Survives extract; not cleared with `expeditionRun`.

## Lifecycle

| Event | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Start / journey advance / upgrade pick | Silent `salvarJogo` with snapshot |
| **Pause expedition** (map footer) | `pauseRunToHub()` — parks run, returns to Forest hub with **Resume** (blocked while a fight is live) |
| Leave Forest / leave `screen-game` | Parks via `suspendRunForWorldLeave()` **only outside combat**. Live fight → `blockLeaveDuringCombat()` (no retreat). Edge interrupt keeps `combatInterrupted` + same path on Resume. |
| Re-enter Forest (parked) | Hub shows **Resume Expedition** (does not auto-jump into the map) |
| Resume | `resumeSuspendedRun()` — restores run vitals + map (town heal does not carry into the run) |
| **Start on another map while parked** | Hub warns (pending on map A). Confirm → extract 100% bag + victory modal → auto-start new run on map B (`confirmExtractToStartOtherZone`). Cancel keeps the parked run. |
| Extract / death | Clears `expeditionRun` after payout. Map footer = bag HUD (totals + “die = half”). Extract confirm = results screen: **100% Extract** vs **50% If you die** (portrait + landscape desk polish). |

## Effects while parked

- `isRunEffectsActive()` is false when `suspended`
- Run % buffs and temporary forge enchants **do not** apply in town
- Resume reapplies them on the expedition map

## Path choices (merchant / rare / warhorn)

- **Merchant** — pick 1 of 3 deals (heal / free mats / named +8% pact); paid deals spend **bag Adena**
- **Rare events** — 2 choices per type (shrine / gambler / cache / storm); storm “Focused” opens a secondary +8% pick
- **Warhorn** — Assault / Tempo / Iron Rally packages (not a fixed buff)
- **Scout / Tracks** — real foresight: Scout (J2+) sets `nextPathBias` (`fight`|`safe`) for the next journey; Tracks (~50%) sets `nextPathGuarantee` (forced path type). Consumed in `generatePathChoices` (ignored on milestone boss / combat-only). Persisted on `expeditionRun`.
- Offers resolve in the same click (no extra save fields for merchant/rare/warhorn)
- **Rules modal** (`#janela-expedition-rules`) + path legend must stay aligned with these systems (i18n `game.hunt.expedition.rules*` / `legendPath*`)

## Run builds (synergy)

- Unlock **as many builds as you complete** — bonuses **stack** (`unlockedBuildIds` on `expeditionRun`; legacy `activeBuildId` migrates on load)
- 8 builds in Offense / Defense / Sustain (Swift Caster, Blade Dancer, Executioner, Spell Fortress, Iron Wall, Trail Warden, Mana Well, Vital Pulse)
- Thresholds tuned for **~4–7 dedicated card picks** per build (not 1–2); mastery at **3 / 5 / 7** is a mid/late-run goal
- Mastery tiers at **3 / 5 / 7** unlocked builds (extra stacked % via `BUILD_MASTERY_TIERS`)
- Bonus % live in `buildBonusBuffs` (rebuilt from catalog on load) — separate from card picks; combat uses `getCombinedBuffPct` (cards + builds)
- Dedicated **Builds** tab — role groups, mastery track, stacked-bonus list, closest-build tip; upgrade cards show **Toward** / **Unlocks** hints; Stats chips mark ★ when builds contribute
- Compact chips still on the upgrade pick modal

## Honesty (§12.7)

Still **client-authoritative** bag credit on extract. Persistence only prevents silent loss on reload/navigation.
